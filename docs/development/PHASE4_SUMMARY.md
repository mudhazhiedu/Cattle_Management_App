## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### 1. Pull Latest Code
```bash
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@98.90.190.211
cd Cattle_Management_App
git pull origin main
```

### 2. Rebuild and Deploy
```bash
# Option A: Pull pre-built images (faster)
docker compose -f docker-compose.ec2.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.ec2.yml up -d

# Option B: Build on EC2 (slower)
docker compose -f docker-compose.ec2.yml up -d --build
```

### 3. Verify Database Migration
```bash
# Check logs for "Database connected" and table creation
docker compose -f docker-compose.ec2.yml logs backend | grep -i "table\|database"
```

### 4. Test New Features
```bash
# Test reminders endpoint
curl http://localhost:5000/api/reminders/count \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Test financial endpoint
curl http://localhost:5000/api/financial/summary \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### 5. Access Frontend

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Manual Reminders**: Reminders must be created manually (auto-generation coming in Phase 5)
2. **No Email/SMS**: Notifications only in-app (external notifications coming in Phase 5)
3. **Basic Milking Form**: Quality fields not yet in UI (enhancement coming soon)
4. **No Reports Export**: PDF/Excel export not yet implemented
5. **No Bulk Operations**: Can't bulk-create transactions or health records

### Minor Issues
- Reminders widget shows max 5 items (intentional for dashboard space)
- Financial summary doesn't filter by date range yet (coming soon)
- Health records don't auto-create reminders for next due dates (Phase 5)
