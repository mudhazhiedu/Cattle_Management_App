# Phase 4 Deployment Checklist

## 🚀 Quick Deploy Commands

```bash
# SSH to EC2
ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@98.90.190.211

# Navigate to project
cd Cattle_Management_App

# Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# Pull pre-built images (recommended - faster)
docker compose -f docker-compose.ec2.yml pull

# Restart services
docker compose -f docker-compose.ec2.yml up -d

# Watch logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.ec2.yml logs -f
```

## ✅ Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Check Services Status
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.ec2.yml ps
```
All services should show "Up" status.

### 2. Verify Database Tables
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.ec2.yml exec postgres psql -U cattle_user cattle_db -c "\dt"
```
Should see new tables:
- `reminders`
- `health_records`
- `financial_transactions`

### 3. Test Backend APIs
```bash
# Get auth token first
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin123"}' | jq -r '.token')

# Test reminders endpoint
curl http://localhost:5000/api/reminders/count \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Test financial summary
curl http://localhost:5000/api/financial/summary \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: New tables not created

docker compose -f docker-compose.ec2.yml logs backend | grep -i "table\|sync"

# If needed, force sync
docker compose -f docker-compose.ec2.yml restart backend
```

### Issue: Frontend not showing new pages
```bash
# Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
# Or rebuild frontend
docker compose -f docker-compose.ec2.yml up -d --build cattle_frontend
```

### Issue: API returns 404 for new endpoints
```bash
# Check if routes are registered
docker compose -f docker-compose.ec2.yml logs backend | grep -i "route"

# Restart backend
docker compose -f docker-compose.ec2.yml restart backend
```

### Issue: Database connection errors
```bash
# Check postgres logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.ec2.yml logs postgres

# Restart postgres
docker compose -f docker-compose.ec2.yml restart postgres
```
