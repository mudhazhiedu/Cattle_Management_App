# Open Source Comparison & Gap Analysis

## 📊 Comparison with Leading OSS Cattle Management Systems

### 1. vs. FarmOS (Drupal-based)

**What FarmOS Has That We Don't:**
- ❌ Multi-species support (chickens, pigs, crops)
- ❌ Field/land management
- ❌ Equipment tracking
- ❌ Sensor integration (IoT devices)
- ❌ Weather data integration

- ✅ Auto-financial integration
- ✅ Simpler, focused UI (not bloated)
- ✅ Modern tech stack (React vs Drupal)
- ✅ Faster performance
